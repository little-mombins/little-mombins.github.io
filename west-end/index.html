<p><em>Friday 27th January 2017</em></p>

<p>We kicked off last weekend with a visit to the West End. In November, I had
bought tickets to Aladdin to surprise Markus when he arrived in the London. The
day finally came…</p>

<p>Markus had no idea where we were going, even when we arrived in front of the
theatre! Not surprisingly, when I told him, he had no change in
expression…although he says he was very excited.</p>

<p>We went to the Prince Edward Theatre in Soho! The decor in theatres is always interesting…</p>

<p>Markus was very impressed by the curtain! We had seats at the very back of the theatre.</p>

<p>Aladdin was fantastic! We were both in awe of the amazing costumes and back sets. It was an adaption of the Disney film. Here are some pictures from online.</p>

<p>The colours were vivid and beautiful, and it was very entertaining. Afterwards, we went on a walk through Soho, Chinatown and Covent Garden…</p>
