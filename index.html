    <p><em>Saturday 28th January 2017</em></p>

<p>Markus and I were feeling exhausted, but we finally managed to leave the house
around 3pm. We went for a walk through Hyde Park to go to Marble Arch, where
Markus could go suit shopping for the House of Lords Chinese New Year’s Party
on Monday.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-28-oxford-street/01.jpg" alt="01" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>On our way through the park, there was a hail storm that left a beautiful
rainbow in its wake. We arrived at Marble Arch to do some shopping.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-28-oxford-street/02.jpg" alt="02" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-28-oxford-street/03.jpg" alt="03" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We felt energised after shopping, so we walked down Oxford Street to Soho.
Unfortunately, as it was a Saturday night, we couldn’t find a spot in any of
the restaurants! We ended up walking around for a long time, and decided to
fortify ourselves with a snack.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-28-oxford-street/04.jpg" alt="04" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-28-oxford-street/05.jpg" alt="05" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Fun fact: when I went to China, I bought some street food thinking it was these
waffles. It turned out to be quail eggs, and I ended up with extremely bad food
poisoning.</p>

<p>We tried to go to Chinatown, seeing as it was Chinese New Year, but predictably
all the restaurants were full. We ended up in a fake American diner! Pretty
embarrassing, since we had just come back from the US…still, Markus enjoyed
the food!</p>

    <p><em>Friday 27th January 2017</em></p>

<p>We kicked off last weekend with a visit to the West End. In November, I had
bought tickets to Aladdin to surprise Markus when he arrived in the London. The
day finally came…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/01.jpg" alt="01" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Markus had no idea where we were going, even when we arrived in front of the
theatre! Not surprisingly, when I told him, he had no change in
expression…although he says he was very excited.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/02.jpg" alt="02" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We went to the Prince Edward Theatre in Soho! The decor in theatres is always interesting…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/03.jpg" alt="03" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Markus was very impressed by the curtain! We had seats at the very back of the theatre.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/04.jpg" alt="04" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/06.jpg" alt="06" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Aladdin was fantastic! We were both in awe of the amazing costumes and back sets. It was an adaption of the Disney film. Here are some pictures from online.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/07.jpg" alt="07" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/08.jpg" alt="08" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/09.jpg" alt="09" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The colours were vivid and beautiful, and it was very entertaining. Afterwards, we went on a walk through Soho, Chinatown and Covent Garden…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/10.jpg" alt="10" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/11.jpg" alt="11" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-27-west-end/12.jpg" alt="12" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Wonderful night!</p>

    <p><em>Sunday 7th January 2017</em></p>

<p>Our next adventure around West London was Hyde Park/Kensington. We are
fortunate to live right next to Hyde Park, so we can go on walks through nature
whenever the desire takes us…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/001.jpg" alt="01" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We walked diagonally through Hyde Park, from the North-West side to the South-East side. We ambled through Kensington Gardens, past the Pond, along the Serpentine down to Knightsbridge. Whilst we were walking, we were able to tick off another London tourist essential—a photo in front of the red telephone boxes!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/002.jpg" alt="02" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>What else is there to do in Knightsbridge, apart from go to Harrods and watch the rich Arabs illegally speed in their Ferraris and Porsches?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/003.jpg" alt="03" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/004.jpg" alt="04" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>The highlight of our trip was visiting the famous Harrods food court! We bought a pork pie and a Scotch egg. We were also lucky enough to try a variety of samples, including the best macaroon I’ve ever had.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/005.jpg" alt="05" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/006.jpg" alt="06" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/007.jpg" alt="07" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After eating, we walked around the store, but soon became fatigued by the crowds, oppressively low ceilings and bizarre layout. In our delirium, we nearly bought a designer coat that cost as much as a year’s college education, but somehow we resisted the temptation…</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/008.jpg" alt="08" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We cleared our heads by walking down Brompton Road. We passed the London Oratory, a beautiful Roman Catholic Church. We decided to go in, and were handed a pamphlet at the entrance. I was seriously horrified to see that it was an anti-abortion advertisement! I was so disgusted that I gave the pamphlet back and took a furtive photo inside the Church despite there being ‘No Photos Allowed’ signs everywhere. Take that!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/009.jpg" alt="09" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>After stopping by the Church, we walked down to the museums on Cromwell Road. Luckily for us, the ice-skating rink was still open. It was very magical to see.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/010.jpg" alt="10" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-07_hyde-park-and-kensignton/011.jpg" alt="11" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We then cut up to Kensington High Street. As it was dark at this point, we decided against walking through the park at night. Instead, we casually strolled up <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/apr/07/londons-most-expensive-street-kensington-palace-gardens">Kensington Palace Gardens</a> to get home, which happens to be the most expensive street in Britain.</p>

<p>A very posh day, with a fitting end.</p>

    <p><em>Wednesday January 4th 2017</em></p>

<p>Our first foray into London was to Notting Hill, home of the famous Portobello
Market and Notting Hill Carnival, and famed for being affluent, chic and having
many picturesque, colourful houses. Notting Hill was also the inspiration
behind the British romcom—wait for it—‘Notting Hill’- which stars Julia
Roberts and Hugh Grant, and pushed Hugh Grant into the spotlight as a modern
day Mr. Darcy. Note: I have never watched Notting Hill.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/001.jpg" alt="01" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Notting Hill is only a 15 minute walk away from my flat. Us Mombins decided to
venture out in the early afternoon, so we could spend the rest of the day
exploring.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/002.jpg" alt="02" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Unfortunately, Portobello Market wasn’t open due to it being a Wednesday. This
didn’t deter us, however- the absence of the usual throngs of tourists allowed
us to walk around at a leisurely pace.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/003.jpg" alt="03" class="center-image" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/004.jpg" alt="04" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We popped into <a href="http://www.la-cave.co.uk/">La Cave à Fromage</a> which,
according to their website, is the world’s 3rd most amazing cheese shop! It was
very European, and had the strong fragrance of blue cheese.</p>

<p>We stopped into my favourite used book store, the Oxfam bookshop on Portobello
Road. We spent several happy hours perusing the books, and ended up purchasing
several excellent copies which we have yet to read.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/005.jpg" alt="05" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>We stopped in a variety of other cute boutiques, including a beautiful Japanese
store named <a href="http://tikichris.com/2016/01/21/wasokan-notting-hill/">Wasokan</a>,
which sells matcha and kimonos. It was very special to look through all the
kimonos, which were gorgeous and expensive.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/006.jpg" alt="06" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>I also picked up an octopus broach from a thrift store for £4! If this doesn’t
sum up my personality, I don’t know what does. Some people have even said it
looks like me, based on its shocked expression and wavy arms.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/2017-01-04-notting-hill/007.jpg" alt="07" class="center-image" /></p>

<p>Overall a lovely afternoon in one of London’s most charming neighbourhoods.</p>
